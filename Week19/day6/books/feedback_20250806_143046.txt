URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/books/src/App.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a basic React app structure. It doesn't implement any of the Redux logic, selectors, or the BookList component functionality as described in the exercise.
- The exercise requires using Redux Toolkit, `createSelector`, and specific selectors for genre-based filtering. None of this is present in the provided code.
- Add Redux store setup with reducers and middleware using Redux Toolkit.
- Implement `createSelector` to create selectors like `selectBooks`, `selectHorrorBooks`, `selectFantasyBooks`, and `selectScienceFictionBooks`.
- Create the `BookList` component to display books based on selected genre using the selectors.
- Implement UI interactions (buttons or dropdown) to switch between genres and update the displayed book list.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/books/src/App.test.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a simple React test using `@testing-library/react`. It does not address any of the requirements outlined in the chapter content.  It doesn't use Redux, Redux Toolkit, createSelector, or implement the BookList component as described.
- The code needs to be completely rewritten to fulfill the exercise requirements. This includes creating a Redux store, reducers, selectors (selectBooks, selectHorrorBooks, selectFantasyBooks, selectScienceFictionBooks), and a BookList component that interacts with the Redux store using React-Redux.
- The exercise specifically asks for the use of `createSelector` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` for optimized data fetching, which is entirely absent from this code.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/books/src/BookForm.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code implements a book addition form, not the book inventory management application with selectors as described in the exercise.
- The exercise requires using `createSelector` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` to create selectors for filtering books by genre. This code doesn't use selectors at all.
- The exercise asks for a `BookList` component to display the inventory and handle genre filtering.  This code only provides a form to add books.
- The code lacks the crucial components (`BookList` and selectors) required to fulfill the exercise's objectives.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/books/src/BookList.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The `selectBooks` selector, explicitly requested in the instructions, is missing.  It should return all books from the state.
- The `BookList` component's conditional logic for selecting books based on genre can be simplified using a switch statement or an object lookup for better readability.
- The `BookList` component should ideally handle cases where no books match the selected genre (displaying a 'No books found' message).
- Add error handling for the case where the state doesn't have the expected structure. Consider using optional chaining or nullish coalescing to prevent errors.
- The BookCard component unnecessarily nests the book object within the `book` prop, change it to receive book object directly.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/books/src/features/book/BookSlice.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code is missing the crucial implementation of selectors using `createSelector` from `@reduxjs/toolkit` as instructed in the exercise.  It only provides reducers for adding and deleting books.
- There's no React component (`BookList`) to display the book inventory and interact with the selectors.
- The exercise requires the use of selectors to filter books by genre (Horror, Fantasy, Sci-Fi).  This functionality is absent.
- The initial state is correctly defined, but it lacks the 'Science Fiction' genre example as implied in the instructions.
- Consider adding input validation to prevent issues with adding books (e.g., missing fields).

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only sets up a basic React application with Redux integration.  It doesn't implement any of the functionality described in the exercise, such as creating selectors, filtering books by genre, or building the `BookList` component.
- The exercise requires creating selectors using `createSelector` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`, which is missing.  Selectors for `selectBooks`, `selectHorrorBooks`, `selectFantasyBooks`, and `selectScienceFictionBooks` need to be implemented.
- A `BookList` component needs to be created to display the book inventory and handle genre selection. The UI interaction for switching genres is also missing.
- The initial Redux store needs to be defined with an array of book objects and reducers to manage the state.  This is missing from the provided code.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/books/src/reportWebVitals.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a React performance monitoring function using web-vitals. It has nothing to do with the Redux exercise described in the chapter content.  It should be replaced with code that implements a Redux store, selectors, and a React component to display a book list as specified.
- The code is reasonably readable, but its context is completely wrong for this exercise.
- The performance of the web-vitals code is likely good, assuming web-vitals is well-implemented, but it's irrelevant to the exercise.
