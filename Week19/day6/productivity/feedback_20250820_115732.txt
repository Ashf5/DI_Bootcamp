URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/productivity/src/App.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided `App.js` file is a minimal root component and does not contain any of the core Redux setup (store, reducers, initial state) as required by point 1.
- It does not implement any Redux actions or reducers (point 2). These would typically reside in separate files and be connected to the store.
- There's no usage of `createSelector` for performance optimization, nor any of the specific selectors (`selectTasksByCategory`, `selectCompletedTasks`, `selectCategoryById`) within this file (point 3).
- While it imports `TaskList`, the `App.js` itself does not demonstrate the use of `useSelector` within `TaskList` for category-based filtering, nor does it include a `CategorySelector` component (point 4). It imports `TaskForm` instead, which is not explicitly mentioned as a required component, while `CategorySelector` is.
- The `App.js` file does not utilize `useCallback` for task editing or completion, nor does it implement any UI elements for these functionalities directly (point 5). These concerns are delegated to child components, which are not provided for review.
- To address the Redux requirements, you would need to set up a Redux store using `configureStore` (from `@reduxjs/toolkit`) and wrap your `App` component with a `Provider` from `react-redux`.
- Ensure `TaskList` and `TaskForm` (or `CategorySelector`) correctly implement the Redux integration using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`, and `useCallback` for optimizing callbacks.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/productivity/src/App.test.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a basic React test file and does not implement any of the requested features for the productivity tracker application (Redux setup, actions, reducers, selectors, functional components, task editing/completion).
- Implement Redux store configuration, including combining reducers for tasks and categories.
- Define initial state structures for tasks (e.g., ID, description, category ID, completed status) and categories (e.g., ID, name).
- Create Redux actions and corresponding reducers for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as adding, editing, and deleting categories. Also, implement an action/reducer for updating task progress/completion.
- Utilize `reselect` (or `createSelector` from `@reduxjs/toolkit/reselect`) to create memoized selectors: `selectTasksByCategory`, `selectCompletedTasks`, and `selectCategoryById`.
- Build the `TaskList` functional component to display tasks, using `useSelector` to retrieve tasks based on a selected category. It should also interact with Redux actions for task updates.
- Build the `CategorySelector` functional component to display and allow selection of categories, fetching them via `useSelector`.
- Within `TaskList` or a child component, implement UI elements for task editing and marking tasks as completed. Ensure that handler functions for these actions are memoized using `useCallback` for performance optimization, as specified in the chapter content.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/productivity/src/TaskForm.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code implements a `TaskForm` component, but the instructions explicitly request a `TaskList` and `CategorySelector` component. Please create these specific components.
- Utilize `createSelector` from `reselect` for selecting data from the Redux store (e.g., `categories`). This is a key requirement for Redux performance optimization mentioned in the chapter content and instructions (point 3). Currently, `useSelector(state => state.categories)` can cause unnecessary re-renders if other parts of the state change.
- Apply `useCallback` to memoize the `handleChange` function and the `onClick` handler for the submit button. This aligns with the instruction to use `useCallback` for efficiency (point 5), even though this component is for adding tasks, not editing/completing them.
- The component only handles task *addition*. Extend the functionality to include task editing and completion with UI elements as specified in the instructions (point 5).
- Ensure all specified actions (add, edit, delete tasks; add, edit, delete categories; update task progress) and their corresponding reducers are fully implemented in the Redux setup (point 2).
- For form inputs, it's generally better practice to manage the input's state using `useState` (e.g., `const [taskTitle, setTaskTitle] = useState('')`) and pass an `onChange` handler to the input, rather than relying on `e.target.form.task.value` in the submit handler. This makes the input a controlled component.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement `useCallback` for all event handlers that dispatch Redux actions (e.g., `onClick` handlers in `TaskCard` and `CategoryList`) as explicitly required by the instructions for efficiency.
- Create and utilize the `selectCompletedTasks` selector using `createSelector` to compute the count of completed tasks. This selector is a direct requirement and was not found or used in the provided code.
- Create and utilize the `selectCategoryById` selector using `createSelector` to return category details based on ID. This selector is a direct requirement and was not found or used in the provided code.
- Implement the functionality (actions, reducers, and UI elements) for adding new tasks, editing existing tasks, editing categories, and deleting categories, as these were explicitly listed requirements for actions and UI.
- Replace the `prompt()` dialog in `CategoryList` with a proper UI input element for adding new categories, providing a better user experience and separating concerns.
- Refactor `TaskCard` to destructure the `task` prop directly (e.g., `function TaskCard({ task })`) for cleaner prop access.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week19/day6/productivity/src/features/categories/categorySelectors.js
suggestions for improvement:
- **Complete Missing Requirements:** The provided code only implements one of the three required selectors and none of the other significant Redux setup (store, reducers, initial states), actions/reducers, functional components, or task editing/completion logic. These foundational and core requirements must be implemented to fulfill the task.
- **Implement `selectTasksByCategory`:** Create a memoized selector using `createSelector` that filters tasks based on a given category ID. This will require defining a `tasks` slice in your Redux state.
- **Implement `selectCompletedTasks`:** Create a memoized selector using `createSelector` to compute and return the total count of completed tasks from your `tasks` state.
- **Improve Dynamic Selector Pattern for Performance:** The current pattern `export const selectCategoryById = (catId)=> createSelector(...)` creates a *new memoized selector instance* every time `selectCategoryById(someId)` is called. While functional, this can lead to performance inefficiencies if the returned selector isn't itself memoized by the consumer (e.g., using `useMemo` in a React component), or if the same selector is repeatedly created. A more idiomatic and generally performant pattern for dynamic selectors is to pass the dynamic argument directly to a single memoized selector instance. For example:
    ```javascript
    import { createSelector } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

    const selectCategories = (state) => state.categories;
    // Input selector to get the category ID from the arguments passed to the main selector
    const selectCatId = (state, catId) => catId; 

    export const selectCategoryById = createSelector(
        [selectCategories, selectCatId],
        (categories, catId) => categories.find(cat => cat.id === catId)
    );
    // Usage in a component: const category = useSelector(state => selectCategoryById(state, someId));
    ```
    This ensures that `selectCategoryById` itself is a single memoized function, and its computation only re-runs if `categories` or `catId` changes.
- **Implement Redux Setup:** Define and set up the Redux store using `configureStore` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`, including initial states for `tasks` and `categories` and combining appropriate reducers.
- **Implement Actions and Reducers:** Create action creators and corresponding reducers for `tasks` and `categories` to handle operations like adding, editing, deleting tasks, adding/editing/deleting categories, and updating task progress.
- **Implement Functional Components:** Build the `TaskList` and `CategorySelector` React components, utilizing `useSelector` to connect to the Redux store and display relevant data based on the defined selectors.
- **Integrate `useCallback` for Efficiency:** Use `useCallback` within your React components (e.g., `TaskList`) to memoize event handlers for task editing and completion, preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components when functions are passed down as props.

- Refactor `selectTasksByCategoryId` to use `createSelector` as explicitly required by the instructions. This is crucial for Redux performance optimizations as highlighted in the chapter.
- Correct the logic in `selectTasksByCategoryId` to filter tasks by `categoryId` instead of `task.id`.
- Rename `selectNotCompletedTasks` to `selectCompletedTasks` to match the requirement.
- Modify `selectCompletedTasks` to return the *count* of completed tasks, not an array of tasks. Use `.length` after filtering.
- Correct the filtering logic within `selectNotCompletedTasks` (or `selectCompletedTasks`) from `tasks.filter(tasks.completed === false)` to `tasks.filter(task => task.completed === false)`.
- Implement the `selectCategoryById` selector, utilizing `createSelector`.
- Remove the commented-out code block for `selectTasksByCategoryId` to improve code clarity, or explain its purpose if it represents an abandoned alternative approach.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement a separate Redux slice for 'categories' to manage category state, including actions for adding, editing, and deleting categories, as explicitly required by the 'Redux Setup' and 'Actions and Reducers' sections.
- Create a dedicated selectors file (e.g., `src/selectors.js`) and implement memoized selectors using `createSelector` for `selectTasksByCategory`, `selectCompletedTasks`, and `selectCategoryById` as detailed in the 'Selectors Creation' requirement. This is crucial for addressing 'Redux Performance Optimizations'.
- This code snippet only covers the Redux slice. The next steps would be to build the functional components (`TaskList` and `CategorySelector`) and utilize `useSelector` and `useCallback` within them as outlined in requirements 4 and 5.
- Ensure consistent naming conventions. While `toggleTask` works, `toggleTaskCompletion` might be more descriptive to indicate that only the `completed` status is being toggled.
