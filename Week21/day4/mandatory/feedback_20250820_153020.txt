suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 4, adjust the static method names `Add` and `Subtract` to `add` and `subtract` respectively, to match the lowercase convention specified in the instructions (`add(a: number, b: number): number`).
- In Exercise 5, modify the `PremiumUser` interface to make `membershipLevel` an optional property, as stated in the instructions. Change `membershipLevel: string;` to `membershipLevel?: string;`.
- For Exercise 1, consider adding a subclass that extends `Employee` to explicitly demonstrate the access of the `protected department` property, as this would more fully illustrate the concept of `protected` access, which is accessible within the class and its subclasses.
