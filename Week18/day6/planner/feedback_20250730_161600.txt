URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week18/day6/planner/package.json
suggestions for improvement:
- This is a `package.json` file, not the actual application code.  It only lists dependencies and scripts needed for a React application using Redux.  It doesn't contain the actual Redux store, actions, reducers, or React components required to fulfill the chapter's requirements.
- Add the actual code for the Redux store, actions, reducers, and React components (calendar, task display, task management).
- Implement the features specified in the chapter: adding, editing, deleting tasks, and associating them with specific dates.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week18/day6/planner/public/manifest.json
suggestions for improvement:
- This JSON describes a React app manifest, not the code for a daily planner application.  It provides metadata for the app's icon, display, and theme, but contains no actual application logic.
- The chapter content explicitly requests a Redux-based daily planner with features for adding, editing, deleting, and viewing tasks by day.  This JSON does not address any of these requirements.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week18/day6/planner/src/App.css
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is only CSS styling for a React application. It does not implement any of the functionality required by the chapter content, such as Redux store configuration, action creators, reducers, React components for task management, date picker, or integration with a Redux store.
- The code needs to be replaced with React components and Redux logic to fulfill the requirements.  A complete Redux architecture, including actions, reducers, and connected components, is missing.
- Add components for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, along with a date picker component and a task display component.
- Implement a Redux store to manage the tasks, and connect the components to the store using `react-redux`.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week18/day6/planner/src/redux/actions.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only defines actions and action creators.  It's missing the crucial reducer and React components required to fulfill the chapter's requirements.  A complete daily planner application needs a reducer to manage the Redux store's state, a component to display tasks, components to add/edit/delete tasks, and a date picker.
- Error handling and input validation are missing. The application should gracefully handle edge cases like empty task descriptions or invalid input.
- Consider using a more descriptive naming convention for action types (e.g., `ADD_TASK_FOR_DATE` instead of just `ADD_TASK`). This will improve the maintainability and clarity of the code in the long run.
- The `editTask` action creator needs to specify the date associated with the task being edited.  Currently, it only takes an id.

URL: URL: https://github.com/Ashf5/DI_Bootcamp/blob/main/Week18/day6/planner/src/redux/reducer.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The reducer doesn't explicitly handle tasks for different days.  It uses a single `tasks` array, making it impossible to view tasks for specific days as required. The `date` property in the task object is not utilized for day-specific task management within the reducer.
- Add error handling for cases where the task to be edited or deleted is not found.
- Improve the `ADD_TASK` action to prevent duplicate IDs and handle potential errors during ID generation.
- Consider using a more robust date handling library for better date manipulation and formatting.
- Add unit tests to thoroughly test the reducer's functionality across all action types and edge cases.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a React performance measurement function using web-vitals. It's completely unrelated to the daily planner application described in the chapter content.
- The code itself is well-structured and readable, but its irrelevance to the task makes it unsuitable for the intended purpose.
- The performance of the web-vitals library is generally good, but this is irrelevant to the daily planner's performance requirements.
