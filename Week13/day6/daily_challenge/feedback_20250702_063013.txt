suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only sets up the server and imports a router.  The crucial `trivia.js` router file is missing, preventing a complete evaluation of the quiz functionality. The implementation of GET `/quiz`, POST `/quiz`, and GET `/quiz/score` routes, along with question handling and score tracking are not present.
- Add error handling for cases like missing parameters or incorrect user input.
- Consider using a more robust templating engine (like EJS or Handlebars) for better presentation of the quiz and results instead of relying solely on plain text responses.
- Implement input sanitization to prevent potential vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS).
