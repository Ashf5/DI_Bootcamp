suggestions for improvement:
- The code is missing the actual route definitions in `./routes/index.js`.  The instructions clearly state to create routes for '/' and '/about' in Exercise 1.  These routes need to be implemented to achieve a complete solution for Exercise 1.
- Error handling is missing. The application should gracefully handle potential errors (e.g., connection errors, invalid input).
- Exercise 2 and 3 are entirely missing. The provided code only addresses a portion of Exercise 1.
- The code uses port 5000 instead of 3000 as specified in the instructions.  While not a correctness issue, it deviates from the instructions.
- The `app.use(router)` statement should ideally be placed *before* any static middleware or other route definitions to ensure that the router handles requests properly
- Security best practices are largely absent. Input validation and sanitization should be included to protect against common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS).
